            <h2> Gallo Pinto </h2>
            <p>
                Gallo Pinto is Costa Rica’s beloved breakfast dish, a flavorful mix of rice and black beans
                sautéed with onions, bell peppers, and the signature Lizano sauce. Often served with eggs, cheese,
                plantains, or tortillas, this dish is the perfect way to start your day with a burst of energy. It’s
                more than just food—it’s a tradition, a symbol of Costa Rican pride, and a taste of home for locals.
